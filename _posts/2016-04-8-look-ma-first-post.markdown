## Dear Diary

This blog is a place for all my weird projects and web (or else) experiments that don't fit into my main [portfolio][portfolio] or [twitter][twitter] or [dribbble][dribbble] or my head, but shouldn't just disappear in the abyss.

I'll try to share more of my processes & thoughts to expose my human personality on the Internet, so you, people, know - i'm **not a bot**. Or am I? **Subscribe to my blog to find out!**

Last but not least, I'll use this place as an attempt to systematize my chaotic mess of brain activity & practice my writing (turns out I love to write). Let's bring order to the Universe! (nothing is in order, btw)

## Outro
ðŸ‘‡ If you would like to <s>see something</s> say something - email me! DM! I'm very Internet social. Just, please, don't call me on the phone.
